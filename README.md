# Party Planner
Get your gear ready for the adventure!

Assemble a party and choose wisely the equipment.
Mission success depends on your planning skills.

Your team relies on you, now get comfortable because they will be doing all the hard work!

## Goal
You need to get to the last floor of the dungeon. Well, not you, but your party.
To this end, you must select what party members to include and how to equip them.

Resources are scares at the beginning, but a couple of trips to the lower floors of the dungeon should prove to be profitable.
Lower floors offer lower prices but are safer for your team.

Reach the tenth floor with at least one party member alive to win the game.
Try to reach the top in the lower time possible.

## Controls
Use the UI to add party members and inventory items.

## Rules and information
Party members need to eat at each floor or they will starve.
Each class will have different hunger levels and initial recruitment costs, make your choice wisely.

## Notes
This game was developed for LoveJam2025.
